Seventh Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX

This was the seventh challenge for the University of Birmingham bootcamp in front-end web-developing and UX. In this challenge, I had to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app needed to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I also needed to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library to work with date and time.


Criteria for successful completition of this challenge were:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

I enjoyed this challenge and it was a good way to practice using JQuery instead of Vanilla JS to navigate the DOM and create a dynamic application. I also really enjoyed exploring third-party API's and working with Day.js. 



## Usage

 All you need to do is open [this page](https://chantalcassinijones.github.io/daily-planner-app/) in your browser. The planner will be colour coded, depending on the time of day( grey for past, orange for present and green for future). You can write something in the textbox and it will save into local storage, even if you refresh the page.
